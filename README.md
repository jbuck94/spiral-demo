So plz advise your  customers when sending large amounts so they can have the  choice to use their bank accounts to do the transfer instead.

Remitly makes it difficult to cancel the transaction by saying the funds won't go back into my bank account for up to 10 business days. They took the money out in 5 seconds, but it's going to take 10 business days to return it???

I tried again on another time same errors were happening . I tell you this is the worst ever until they do something.",

I don’t know that the doctors here don’t take credit card. She says it’s fishy because I gave 2 email I said because I have trouble with the internet and I thought the email doesn’t work. At first she open that she wants to speak tagalog. Maybe she has trouble with English and finally she saysshe cannot approve the transfer because . I told her it’s okay I’m not pushing it there’s a lot of companies want my business. May she never had 3 thousand dollars in her lifeand she thinks the only way a Filipina could get hold of that amount. Also she wants my bank statements is she insane?. She will probably freak out if she see my bank account. My husband is a retired U.S. army Col. and I’m retired businesswoman. She isprejudice to Filipina I don’t need to be humiliated and treated like a thief for a stupid 3000. It’s only my lv bag.
